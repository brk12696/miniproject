## Personal Information

I grew up in West Collingswood Heights NJ and I currently live in Haddonfield NJ. I am 24 years old and am in my final semester as a Computer Science Major at Rowan University. 

## Hobbies

In my spare time I enjoy going on runs to stay active. I have been running track and field and cross country since i was 14 and I ran competitevly all throughout my second year of county college. I also enjoy hiking, camping, canoing, and most outdoor activities. When the whether isnt so nice, I love to watch movies (mainly marvel), listen to music, or play video games, which is one of the main reasons i got into computer science in the first place. Some of my favorite video games are Crash Bandicoot, Pacman, and Halo.

## Future Plans

This web programming class is the final class I need for my Bachelor's degree. I am currently applying for jobs and am hoping to land an entry level position as a software engineer, software developer, or application developer. I am also looking for work not in NJ but primarily down south in states such as Florida, Texas, and South Carolina.
